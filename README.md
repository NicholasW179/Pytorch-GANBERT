# Pytorch-GANBERT
A Pytorch implementation of [GAN-BERT](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-main.191.pdf) paper

"bert.py" and "qc-fine_bert.py", and "ganbert.py" and "qc-fine_ganbert.py" files are basically the same; this is just my laziness.
"labeled_and_unlabeled.tsv" is the mixed version of labeled and unlabeled data from original [tensorflow implementation](https://github.com/crux82/ganbert) of the paper.
